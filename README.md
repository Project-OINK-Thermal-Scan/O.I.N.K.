Thermal infrared image pig ear dataset
# TIRPigEar
Welcome to our TIRPigEar! This dataset contains 23,189 thermal infrared images of pig ears, primarily aimed at various visual tasks such as pig ear object detection, object tracking, pose estimation, behavior recognition, individual identification, pig head temperature detection, and health assessment. The TIRPigEar dataset was collected using a pig barn health inspection robot equipped with an infrared thermal imager, and data post-processing was performed through manual annotation. By annotating pig ear targets in the images, 69,567 label files were generated, which can be directly used for training deep learning models for pig ear object detection. The precision, recall, and mAP50 of the thermal infrared pig ear image dataset achieved the highest values with the YOLOv9m model, reaching 97.35%, 98.1%, and 98.6%, respectively. Utilizing thermal infrared imaging technology to detect pig ear information is a non-contact, fast, and effective method. Establishing the TIRPigEar thermal infrared image dataset is of great significance for improving pig farming management, ensuring pigs' health and welfare, and enhancing production efficiency.

We welcome feedback and corrections from all experts and will continue to update, refine, and share the relevant data in the future.

我们首次公开了热红外猪耳图像数据集TIRPigEar。该数据集包含23189张生猪耳部热红外图像，主要面向生猪的猪耳目标检测、目标跟踪、姿态估计、行为识别、个体识别、猪头温度检测、健康评估等多种视觉任务。TIRPigEar数据集采用连接有红外热成像仪的猪舍健康巡检机器人进行获取，并采用人工标注方式进行数据后处理。通过对图像中的猪耳目标进行标注，共获得69567个标签文件，可直接用于深度学习猪耳目标检测模型训练。猪耳部热红外图像数据集的精度、召回率和mAP50在YOLOv9m模型中达到最高，分别为97.35%、98.1%、98.6%。用热红外成像技术检测猪只耳部信息是一种非接触、快速且有效的方法，建立热红外图像TIRPigEar数据集对于提升生猪养殖管理水平、保障猪只健康和福利、以及提高生产效率都有重要意义。

欢迎各位老师批评指正，后续我们将会继续更新、完善和共享相关数据。

# YOLO dataset download (this repository)

A ready-to-train **YOLO-format** copy of TIRPigEar-23189 — 23,189 thermal-infrared
images (23,189 JPEG + 23,189 label `.txt`), split into train / val / test — is
published as a GitHub release:

**https://github.com/Project-OINK-Thermal-Scan/O.I.N.K./releases/tag/dataset-v1**

The archive is 4.97 GB, so it ships as three parts (GitHub caps release assets at
2 GB each). Allow **~10 GB free**: ~5 GB for the parts plus ~5 GB once extracted
(23,189 JPEGs + labels). Download all three, then reassemble and verify in one
chained command:

```bash
cat TIRpigear-23189-yolo.zip.part00 \
    TIRpigear-23189-yolo.zip.part01 \
    TIRpigear-23189-yolo.zip.part02 > TIRpigear-23189-yolo.zip \
  && sha256sum -c <<<'c40cadcf2c64e3ca68db3b270ca3844b748ff2127735108914aed6617b659cc9  TIRpigear-23189-yolo.zip' \
  && unzip TIRpigear-23189-yolo.zip
```

Parts are named explicitly rather than with a `*` glob, and the `&&` chain stops
before `unzip` if a part is missing or the checksum does not match.

Alternatively, `datasets/download.sh` pulls the upstream TIRPigEar archives
directly from HuggingFace, with resume and checksum verification.
